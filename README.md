# CSCE-313-Project-5
Client/server program that sends messages between two different classes using FIFO queues and an event handler thread

100 requests for each of three people "John Smith," "Joe Smith," and "Jane Smith" are requested from the server; the server sends back data in the form of random numbers which are displayed in a histogram.

Runs with commands `make` and then `./client`
